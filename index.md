> This website documents the features of the current `main` branch of the Just the Docs theme. See [the CHANGELOG]({% link CHANGELOG.md %}) for a list of releases, new features, and bug fixes. -->


I am an incoming assistant professor in the [Department of Software Engineering](https://www.rit.edu/computing/department-software-engineering) at [Rochester Institute of Technology](https://www.rit.edu/), USA, and currently a Horizon Postdoctoral Fellow in the [Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering](https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/computer-science-software-eng.html) at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/), Canada. I received my Ph.D. in [Computer Science](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/computer-science) from [City University of New York-Graduate Center](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/), USA. I was the instructor of Hunter College Cyber Security Summer Camp, which was only open to non-CS female undergraduates who were interested in CS. My research areas include software quality, empirical software engineering, and software logging. My research has been published in flagship software engineering research venues such as ICSE, TSE, and EMSE. My work has won the best (distinguished) paper awards at two international software engineering conferences. 



<!-- Just the Docs is a theme for generating static websites with [Jekyll]. You can write source files for your web pages using [Markdown], the [Liquid] templating language, and HTML.[^1] Jekyll builds your site by converting all files that have [front matter] to HTML. Your [Jekyll configuration] file determines which theme to use, and sets general parameters for your site, such as the URL of its home page.

Jekyll builds this Just the Docs theme docs website using the theme itself. These web pages show how your web pages will look *by default* when you use this theme. But you can easily *[customize]* the theme to make them look completely different!

Browse the docs to learn more about how to use this theme. -->

<!-- ## Getting started

The [Just the Docs Template] provides the simplest, quickest, and easiest way to create a new website that uses the Just the Docs theme. To get started with creating a site, just click "[use the template]"! -->

{: .note }
I am looking for ***self-motivated*** Ph.D., Master's and undergraduate students. Please contact me if you are interested in software engineering research.
<!-- To use the theme, you do ***not*** need to clone or fork the [Just the Docs repo]! You should do that only if you intend to browse the theme docs locally, contribute to the development of the theme, or develop a new theme based on Just the Docs. -->
